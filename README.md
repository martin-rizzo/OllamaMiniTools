# ðŸ§° OllamaMiniTools

</div>

**OllamaMiniTools** is a humble collection of simple scripts designed to streamline the setup process for Ollama models. This project is primarily for personal use, and while it has been tested in my own use cases, it may not function as expected in other contexts.

## Scripts Included

Currently, OllamaMiniTools includes two basic scripts:

1. **gguf-merge**: Use this script to merge two GGUF files into one. For more information run `./gguf-merge.sh --help`.

2. **omodel**: This tool provides commands for listing Ollama models, exporting model files and importing and modifying them. For a full list of commands and further details, execute `./omodel.sh --help`.

The repository is evolving as I continue to explore ways to streamline ollama model processes. Feedback or contributions are welcome if you find these tools helpful.

Feel free to use and experiment with the scripts at your own risk!
