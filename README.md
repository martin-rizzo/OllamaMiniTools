# OllamaMiniTools

Welcome to OllamaMiniTools, a humble collection of simple scripts aimed at making the setup process for ollama models a bit easier. This project is primarily a personal experiment, and while it has been tested in my own use cases, it may not function as expected outside this context.

## Scripts Included

Currently, OllamaMiniTools includes two basic scripts:

1. **gguf-merge.sh**: Use this script to merge two GGUF files into one. For more information on how to use it and available options (such as disabling color output or viewing help messages), run `./gguf-merge.sh --help`.

2. **omodel.sh**: This tool provides commands for listing Ollama models, exporting model files, importing and modifying them, and displaying this help message. For a full list of commands and further details, execute `./omodel.sh --help`.

The repository is evolving as I continue to explore ways to streamline ollama model processes. Feedback or contributions are welcome if you find these tools helpful.

Feel free to use and experiment with the scripts at your own risk!
